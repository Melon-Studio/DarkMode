## 📂Discription

DarkMode is a software that runs under Windows 11 and provides automatic switching of dark mode, written in C#.



## 🧡Software advantages

real-time changes——Using the Task Scheduler to achieve this functionality is not desirable. If you are in the dark theme time period after booting, the task plan will not execute this task, so you will not switch the dark theme, so real-time change is a major feature of this software.

Lightweight——The software is developed using the C# language .NET Framework 4.7.2 framework. The software only takes up less than 1MB of ROM and only about 10MB of RAM, making it truly lightweight software.

Automatic start——The software can be set to start automatically when it is turned on, to ensure that it will run normally every time it is turned on, serve users, and can be turned off at any time when you don't want to use it.

Multilingual Support——The software supports four languages in three countries, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Japanese and English.

Wallpaper Engine wallpaper switching——The software not only supports switching native wallpapers, but also can switch Wallpaper Engine wallpapers, please refer to Wiki for help.
